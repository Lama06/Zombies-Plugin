## Getting started

- Download the plugin's latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Lama06/Zombies-Plugin/releases/latest).
- Download the [Dead End map](https://github.com/Lama06/Zombies-Plugin/releases/tag/world) and add it to your server:
  - Either delete your server's world directory and replace it with the Dead End world
  - or use a world management plugin to add it to your server.
- Join the server, enter the world you added and execute `/zombies loadTemplate` to load the default configuration for Dead End.
- Use `/zombies start` to start a game and `/zombies stop` to stop a game.
- Have fun!
